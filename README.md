# website-down

This script monitors a list of websites and sends an email alert if one or more websites are down. The script checks the websites' status by sending HTTP requests and verifying the response. It's written in Python 3 and uses the `requests` library to send HTTP requests.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library

## Installation

1. Install the `requests` library if you haven't already:

```bash
pip3 install requests

Enjoy!
